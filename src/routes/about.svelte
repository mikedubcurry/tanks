	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>
		Over the past couple of years, I've made a few games using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This site
		is a sort of arcade to display my work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most games have some concept of scoring and players that get the highest score will win the
		honor of having their score saved in the site's <a href="/highscores">Leaderboard</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't collect any data, except for any score or optional initials you enter when you get a
		high score. Any text you enter into the initials that I deem inappropriate will be removed.
	</p>

		Feel free to check out <a href="https://mikecurry.dev">my personal site</a> to see what else I have
		made, or leave a message in the contact form.
